## ITMD 362, Production Problem 02: Color Palettes

For this production problem, you’re going to create several custom color palettes on the site
Paletton, http://paletton.com.

Before you start, be sure to read through the color theory readings on the course calendar for Week
Four.

Once you’ve read, you’ll choose a palette based on each prompt below, and paste the Paletton URL in
with your chosen palette (you’ll see that the `uid` value in the Paletton URL changes with each
adjustment that you make). Write a few sentences explaining why you chose the colors you did.

Opt for the Paletton Preview mode “Default with Text,” so you can see how text looks on each palette
you choose. Use the Preview tab at the bottom of the palette preview.

1. A **monochromatic color palette** for a site introducing a new console gaming platform

Your Palette URL: https://paletton.com/#uid=14a0u0knknB8RE8g+stspi0DRbl
Your Rationale: I chose this color because I always wanted to deviate from the U.S Navy pride colors of Blue and Gold. I also have always set these colors to the background of my Playstation and if I introduced a new gaming console it would be  a military edition style similar to the PS system.

2. An **adjacent color palette** for announcing springtime tours at the Chicago Botanical Gardens
