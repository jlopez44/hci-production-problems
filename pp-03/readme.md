## ITMD 362, Production Problem 03: Implementing HCI Guidelines for Touchscreens

## The Problem

You’ve read about HCI guideline’s throughout Josh Clark’s *Designing for Touch*. This Production
Problem is your opportunity to apply them to an existing form.

Using the HCI guidelines from either iOS or Android, sketch a new small-screen touch-friendly design
for the membership account-creation page for Chicago’s Museum of Contemporary Art at https://experience.mcachicago.org/account/create (Hint: visit the URL on your phone).

**You only need to sketch your redesign**, and in the text below, reference at least three different
points of guidance from chosen HCI guidelines that went into your redesign sketches (you might
want to do multiple sketches, each highlighting a different feature of the same overall design).

## Resources

Choose from either Apple’s or Google’s design guidelines:

* Apple iOS HCI Guidlines:
  https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/
* Google Material Design 3 Guidelines:
  https://m3.material.io

## Deliverables

Small commits to your Production Problems repository that include:

1. Photographs of sketches of your new design, from your sketchbook, or digital sketches
2. An explanation of three different points of guidance from your chosen guidelines (point to the
   specific URL where the guidance can be found) that you implemented in your sketch, written below:

* HCI Guideline One (URL):https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/controls/buttons/
* Describe how you implemented that guideline in your sketch:I chose to improve the buttons on this webpage first and foremost because it is the MCAchicago it is the site for an ART Museum and I believe that is was very important. In creating and redesigning the button layouts I kept in mind  that button content shpould help people instantly understand what the button is for .

* HCI Guideline Two (URL):https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/visual-design/branding/
* Describe how you implemented that guideline in your sketch:The MCA is one of the top museums in the nation /world so branding is very important. I resisted the temptation to display logo throughout the webpage so that the reader can focus more on accessibility and navigating the content.

* HCI Guideline Three (URL):https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/visual-design/color/
* Describe how you implemented that guideline in your sketch: Last but not least, Color is what wraps everything else together, the branding the buttons etc. I chose to use color judiciously for communication and call attention to only important information.  

For the Production Problem discussion next week, be sure to share your sketches and chosen
guidelines.
